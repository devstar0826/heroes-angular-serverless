# Heroes Angular Serverless

TypeScript Node/Express ðŸ‘‰TypeScript Serverless âž• Angular

This project was created to help represent a fundamental app written with Angular and Node.js/Express. The heroes and villains theme is used throughout the app. The app is migrated from Node.js/Express to Azure Functions.

Structure:

```
- server    // Node.js Express server using TypeScript
- src       // Angular front-end app
- functions // Azure Functions APIs
```

## The Story

You created an Angular app and its static assets are served by Node.js. All of your code in Angular and Node are written with TypeScript, because you love how it helps identify and fix issues while you are creating your code. Your data is accessed via the same Node.js server through Express.js hitting a database (in this case Azure's Cosmos DB). This all works beautifully!

Now you want to host the Angular app on a web site in the cloud. You can absolutely host the app and Node in the cloud, but you're thinking it would be great if you could just host the Angular app without having to worry about a server.

You decide to migrate your Node.js Express APIs to serverless functions, and host your Angular app and its static assets in the cloud!

## Why

I love JavaScript and the Web! One of the most common questions I hear is "which framework is best?". I like to flip this around and ask you "which is best for you?". The best way to know this is to try it for yourself. I'll follow up with some articles on my experiences with these frameworks but in the meantime, please try it for yourself to gain your own experience with each.

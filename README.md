# Heroes Angular Serverless

TypeScript Node/Express ðŸ‘‰TypeScript Serverless âž•Angular

This project was created to help represent a fundamental app written with Node Express APIs and TypeScript that can be shifted to Serverless Functions with TypeScript.

The client app is Angular, however it could just as easily be Vue or React. The heroes and villains theme is used throughout the app.

Comparative client apps written with Vue and React can be found at at [github.com/johnpapa/heroes-vue](https://github.com/johnpapa/heroes-vue) and [github.com/johnpapa/heroes-react](https://github.com/johnpapa/heroes-react)

## Why

I love Node and Express for creating APIs! These require a server and paying for that server in the cloud. Shifting to serverless alleviates the cost, the server upkeep, helps scale up and down easily, and reduces the surface are of the middleware required for a robust Express app. Is it perfect? No, of course not! But this is a solid option if these factors affect you.
